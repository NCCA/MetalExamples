## Metal Examples

A series of examples using the new [metal-cpp](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/) bindings from Apple.

I have started by converting some of examples from [mtlpp](https://github.com/naleksiev/mtlpp) as I am familiar with them. I will then create simple SDL, GLFW and Qt versions which will eventually be added to the [NGL](https://github.com/NCCA/NGL) library as a backend.

This is very much work in progress.
